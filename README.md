# My RESTful APIs development track
![Banner](RESTful%20API%20Journey.png)

## What's this for ?
I'll track my development and skill level through days and weeks and list a bunch of topics so i don't lose track of time nor important topics. It'll be more of a to-do list rather than a github repo with a bunch of codes, But still there'll be some code so in the end i can test it by deploying on Heroku.


## The End Goal 
The Final goal I'm aiming for building and deploy a prototype of machine learning or web apps or robust API prototype. So to sharpen my skills and add another sharp tool in my development box. I'll document the journey here.


## Looks like an important topic
Here I'll write topics seems to be important.....
- integrate SQLlite
- Flask SQLAlchemy
- Token refreshing & Flask-JWT
- Sessions
- Authentication
- Session stores
